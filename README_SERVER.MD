# Server

[Back](README.MD)

The FoldingCoin stats service is designed to be run on a Linux based webserver. The
repository has been configured and tested around the following:

* Ubuntu 17.04
* Apache 2
* MySQL 5.7
* PHP 7.1

There should be no reason why the service does not run on other distributions of Linux
however in order for this to work it may be necessary for developers to create a
modified version of the provisioning script to cater for distribution specific changes
in software packaging.
