# Directory Structure

[Back](../README.MD)

## storage

The storage directory contains your compiled Blade templates, file based sessions, file caches, 
and other files generated by the framework. This directory is segregated into app, framework, 
and  logs directories. The app directory may be used to store any files generated by your 
application. The framework directory is used to store framework generated files and caches. 
Finally, the logs directory contains your application's log files.

The storage/app/public directory may be used to store user-generated files, such as profile 
avatars, that should be publicly accessible. You should create a symbolic link at public/storage
which points to this directory. You may create the link using the php artisan storage:link 
command.
