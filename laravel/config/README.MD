# Directory Structure

[Back](../README.MD)

## config

The config directory, as the name implies, contains all of your application's configuration 
files. It's a great idea to read through all of these files and familiarize yourself with all of
the options available to you.

When new third-party vendor packages are added they may also publish their configuration files
into this folder.
