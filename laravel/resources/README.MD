# Directory Structure

[Back](../README.MD)

## resources

The resources directory contains your views as well as your raw, un-compiled assets such as 
LESS, SASS, or JavaScript. This directory also houses all of your language files, images and
scripts which will be processed by NPM and deployed to the `public` folder of the webserver
as configured in the `webpack.mix.js` file.
