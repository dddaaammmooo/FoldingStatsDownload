# Directory Structure

[Back](../README.MD)

## app

The app directory, as you might expect, contains the core code of your application. Almost all 
of the classes in the application will be in this directory or one of its child folders.

##### Folders

* [Console](Console/README.MD) (The command-line/scheduled CRON task executers will live here)
* [Exceptions](Exceptions/README.MD)
* [Http](Http/README.MD) (The frontend webside code will live here)
* [Providers](Providers/README.MD)
* [Services](Services/README.MD) (The majority of the stats download service code will live here)
