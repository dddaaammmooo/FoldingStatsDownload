# Directory Structure

[Back](../README.MD)

## bootstrap

The bootstrap directory contains files that bootstrap the framework and configure autoloading. 
This directory also houses a cache directory which contains framework generated files for 
performance optimization such as the route and services cache files.

It would typically be expected that no changes should be required in this folder.
